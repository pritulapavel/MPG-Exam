# ✨ Key Features & Technical Implementation

## 1️⃣ Modular SCSS Architecture

The project follows a **Mobile-First approach** with reusable breakpoint mixins.

```scss
@include tablet {
  /* Tablet-specific adjustments */
}

@include laptop {
  /* Desktop 3-column layout */
}
```

Benefits:

- Scalable styling structure
- Easier collaboration
- Cleaner component isolation

---

## 2️⃣ Dynamic Card Stack Effect

To replicate Spotify’s **card stacking UI effect**, we combined **CSS pseudo-elements** with **JavaScript-driven variables**.

**Implementation**

- `::before` and `::after` create depth layers
- JavaScript dynamically extracts **image sources**
- CSS custom properties generate background effects

Result: A **layered visual card stack** similar to Spotify’s UI.

---

## 3️⃣ Responsive Layout Grid

The layout adapts across three major breakpoints.

| Device     | Layout                                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 📱 Mobile  | Single-column scrolling layout           |
| 📱 Tablet  | Dual-section layout with floating player |
| 💻 Desktop | Full **3-column architecture**           |

```
Sidebar | Main Content | Activity Feed
```
